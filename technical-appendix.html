  <h1>Technical Appendix</h1>
  <p>This technical appendix provides details on the data sources, methodology, and assumptions used in the LonelyLessAustralia Decision Aid Tool. It covers how programme uptake is estimated using discrete choice experiment (DCE) data, the cost components and their sources, and how benefits are calculated using both quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and willingness-to-pay (WTP) measures. References to relevant literature are included to support these assumptions.</p>
  
  <h2>Loneliness Prevalence and Impact</h2>
  <p>Loneliness is a significant issue among older adults. Approximately 17–19% of Australians aged 65 and over experience persistent loneliness. Prolonged loneliness is linked with higher risks of depression, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and early mortality. It is also associated with increased health service use; for example, lonely older individuals may visit doctors more frequently, possibly seeking social interaction. The economic burden is substantial: one study estimated the annual cost of loneliness in Australia at around A$2.7 billion (about A$1,565 per person who remains lonely). These figures underscore the importance of cost-effective interventions to reduce loneliness.</p>
  
  <h2>Uptake Estimation via DCE</h2>
  <p>The tool predicts programme uptake using a DCE-derived multinomial logit model. In the underlying DCE, older adults chose between hypothetical program scenarios (varying by attributes like cost, frequency, etc.) and a “no program” option. The model coefficients (shown in the code) quantify how each attribute affects the utility of a program relative to opting out. For instance, a positive coefficient for <em>Weekly</em> sessions means respondents prefer weekly over daily sessions (the reference), increasing uptake probability, while a negative coefficient for <em>Virtual</em> delivery indicates a deterrent effect on uptake. These preferences align with other findings that older adults favor in-person, frequent engagements.</p>
  <p>The probability of choosing a given program configuration is calculated with the logit formula using the attribute coefficients. The model includes an alternative-specific constant for opting out, capturing baseline reluctance to participate. When you configure a scenario and click <strong>Apply Configuration</strong>, the tool computes the utility of that scenario and converts it to an uptake percentage (e.g., 60% uptake means 60% of a similar population would enroll). Lowering the session fee or adding more attractive features (like community engagement) increases this probability, all else equal.</p>
  
  <h2>Willingness-to-Pay for Attributes</h2>
  <p>Each attribute’s WTP is derived from the DCE by dividing its coefficient by the (negative) cost coefficient. WTP represents how much money, on average, participants are willing to pay for that feature. For example, the model estimates older adults would pay about A$14.47 extra per session for a <em>Community engagement</em> program versus a peer support group. In contrast, they value a fully <em>Virtual</em> program less, with a WTP of -A$11.69 (meaning they'd require an $11.69 discount per session to accept an all-virtual format). These values are based on the survey data and are shown in the WTP Results tab with standard errors and p-values for reference.</p>
  <p>The tool uses WTP in two ways: to display the value of each attribute (in the WTP chart), and as an optional basis for benefit-cost analysis. In the Costs &amp; Benefits tab, the total WTP benefit is calculated by summing WTP for the selected attributes (relative to the reference scenario) across all sessions and participants. This essentially measures participants’ total “consumer surplus” – the monetary value of the program to them. A scenario can then be evaluated by comparing total WTP to total costs. If participants’ total WTP exceeds costs, the program can be considered efficient from a consumer perspective, even if health-based metrics differ.</p>
  
  <h2>Cost Components and Sources</h2>
  <p>The cost inputs are informed by a modelled intervention in Australia (the Friendship Enrichment Programme) and related sources. Key cost components include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> A$2,978.80 for two local newspaper ads. This cost is drawn from the ROI analysis assumptions for reaching older adults via media.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaflets (Printing &amp; Postage):</strong> A$0.12 printing + A$0.15 postage per leaflet, for 10,000 leaflets (total ≈A$2,670). These cover community mail-outs to raise awareness.</li>
    <li><strong>Administrative staff:</strong> A$49.99/hour for 10 hours (~A$500) for a coordinator to manage recruitment and logistics (assumes ~$50/hour including on-costs).</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitator training:</strong> A$223.86 per facilitator for a 5-hour training (includes wages plus 30% on-costs). We model 100 units (~100 facilitators across groups) for A$22,386 total.</li>
    <li><strong>On-costs (30%):</strong> A$44.77 per facilitator to cover benefits/overheads (already included in the above training cost, but broken out in the model as well).</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitation of sessions:</strong> A$100 per session (for a group session led by a facilitator). For 100 sessions (e.g., ~8–10 groups meeting 12 times each) this totals A$10,000. This cost is consistent with paying a facilitator ~$50/hour for a 2-hour session.</li>
    <li><strong>Materials:</strong> A$50 per participant for session materials (e.g., handouts, workbooks, supplies). This is a rounded estimate (Engel et al. used ~A$23 per participant), providing a buffer for better-quality materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Venue hire:</strong> A$15 per session for venue (assuming many community venues are free or low-cost). At 100 sessions, that is A$1,500 total. In Engel et al.’s model, 40% of sessions incurred a venue cost, averaged here as A$15/session.</li>
    <li><strong>Participant time:</strong> A$20 per session per participant, reflecting the opportunity cost of their time (roughly half the average wage, acknowledging many are retired). This cost is included only if the “Include Participant Cost” toggle is set to Yes.</li>
    <li><strong>Participant travel:</strong> A$10 per session per participant for travel expenses (fuel, public transit, etc.), also included only if toggled on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All costs are in Australian dollars. The “Cost-of-Living Adjustment” allows the user to scale the session fee by state (using multipliers like +10% for NSW, +15% for ACT, etc.) to simulate regional cost differences. This adjustment influences uptake (since it changes the out-of-pocket cost) but does not change other fixed costs. The participant time and travel costs can be toggled on to take a societal perspective (including all costs), or off to take a program perspective (including only direct program expenditures).</p>
  
  <h2>Benefit-Cost Analysis (QALYs and WTP)</h2>
  <p>The tool evaluates benefits using two approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Health outcomes (QALYs):</strong> Users can assume a low (0.02), moderate (0.05), or high (0.1) QALY improvement per participant from the program (e.g., by reducing loneliness-related depression) based on literature. The moderate scenario (0.05 QALYs) roughly corresponds to preventing depression in a small fraction of participants. Monetising QALYs at A$50,000 each is a common practice in Australian health economics. Thus, 0.05 QALYs is valued at A$2,500. The tool multiplies this by the number of participants to get total monetised health benefits. If, say, 100 participants each gain 0.05 QALYs (total 5 QALYs ≈ A$250k benefit) and the program costs A$100k, the net benefit is A$150k and the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is 2.5.</li>
    <li><strong>Participant WTP:</strong> As discussed, the tool also computes total participant WTP for the program’s features. Continuing the above example, if participants on average would pay A$15 extra per session for the program configuration and each attends 12 sessions, that’s A$180 of value per participant. For 100 participants, total WTP = A$18k. This can be compared to costs (A$100k) giving a BCR around 0.18. In this case the program is not justified on WTP alone, but was justified on QALY gains – illustrating how different perspectives yield different insights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Results Summary provides a recommendation based on the QALY perspective (since health outcomes are often primary in policy decisions). A configuration with high uptake and BCR &gt; 1 (QALY) will be described as attractive, whereas one with low uptake or BCR &lt; 1 will get cautionary advice. Both net benefit and BCR are displayed for transparency. Additionally, the cost-benefit analysis section explicitly shows the WTP-based outcome so users can consider intangible benefits that QALYs might not capture (such as improved social connectedness valued by participants).</p>
  <p>Including participant costs tends to lower the BCR significantly. Engel et al. (2021) found that when the opportunity cost of volunteer time was included, an intervention’s ROI dropped from 2.87 to 0.62, no longer meeting the cost-effectiveness threshold. The tool allows users to see this effect: toggling “Include Participant Cost” to Yes increases total costs (adding the imputed value of time and travel) and will often push net benefit into negative territory unless the QALY gains are very high. This helps policymakers understand the importance of perspective – from a health system perspective an intervention might save money (excluding patient time), but from a societal perspective it could be cost-incurring.</p>
  
  <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
  <p><strong>Loneliness-Free Days:</strong> An alternate measure of benefit not in the tool is the increase in “loneliness-free days.” This metric was used in the National Mental Health Commission’s analysis of the Friendship Enrichment Programme, which achieved millions of additional days that participants did not feel lonely over a 5-year period. Such a measure can be meaningful to stakeholders in social care. While our tool focuses on QALYs (which capture broad quality of life changes), translating outcomes into loneliness-free days is possible if the intervention’s direct effect on loneliness scores is known.</p>
  <p><strong>Avoided Healthcare Costs:</strong> Reductions in loneliness are expected to translate to fewer GP visits, emergency presentations, and delayed entry into aged care. These avoided costs are not explicitly calculated in this tool’s net benefit but were part of the ROI in other studies. For instance, preventing a case of depression can save thousands in treatment costs. Decision-makers can qualitatively factor these savings in – our cost-effectiveness threshold of $50k/QALY implicitly accounts for health system savings to an extent. If an intervention yields a net cost but also prevents expensive adverse outcomes, the real-world value might be higher than the financial analysis alone suggests.</p>
